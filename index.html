         I saw Sabrina live on a whim. A good friend of mine really wanted to see
        her, but didn't have anyone to go with. As a lover of music, I
        couldn't turn down $40 general admission tickets. We sat outside for
        about 3 hours and ended up a few rows back from the stage. Sabrina's
        opener was Blu DeTiger, I had never heard of them before, but they were
        awesome. Very involved with the crowd, took the time to teach us the
        chorus of a song so we could sing along, and were overall a great vibe.
        When Sabrina came on stage, the venue was immediately filled with
        screams. While I didn't know much of her music at that point, it was such an amazing performance. 
        The lighting was perfect, the props were gorgeous, heart confetti fell from the ceiling, and Sabrina
        was so involved with the crowd throughout the whole show.

         Would I see her again? Yes.

         <b>Noah Kahan</b>
      </h2>
      <h3>
         <i>Bonnaroo Music Festival, 2023</i>
      </h3>
      <p>
         Noah Kahan has been one of my favorite artists since 2020, I found him randomly on youtube. 
         My friend and I had bought our tickets to Bonnaroo before the line up was released, so when 
         I saw that Noah Kahan would be at the festival, I knew I HAD to make room to see him. I stood through 2 sets 
         before Noah came on stage, but the wait was worth it! Noah is extremely funny, personable, and he sounds so amazing
         live. It was an experience, to say the absolute least about it. The energy his fans have is so overwhelmingly warm
         and you can feel that energy throughout the whole show. Noah Kahan was an absolute must see and be prepared to cry.\
      </p>
      <p>
         Would I see him again? Absolutely, yes.
      </p>
      <p>
         Would I recommend him to a friend? I'd recommend him to strangers.

      <h3>
         <i>The Old Rock House, 2023</i>
      </h3>
      <p>
         Wow, just wow. The Old Rock House is a small, intimate venue, so Hobo Johnson (also known as Frank) was so close! 
         Hobo produces his own music, so having him on stage, messing with his sound board and just having fun, it was a phenominal time.
         He had his friends opening for him, which was adorable and they were all so talented! There was definitely some mess ups in the set, but 
         it only added to his authenticity. His emotional, yet sometimes goofy, music is perfect for small venues and connecting with the crowd. 
       </p>
       <p>
         Would I see him again? Every time he's in town.
       </p>
       <p>
         Would I recommend him to a friend? Specific ones, but yes!

      <h3>
         <i>The Pageant, 2023</i>
      </h3>
      <p>
         Half.Alive is another show that has remained in my top 5 since I have seen them.
         They opened their show with a giant white sheet covering the entire front of the stage. 
         Behind the curtain was a light, creating a siloutte of anything passing in front of the light.
         They performed the first half of Tip Toes using their silouttes to convey the emotions. Half.Alive 
         gave me chills to see perform, the artistry in every single song they put on was jaw dropping. It 
         wasn't a casual indie band concert, it was a display of art and all of the emotions they put into their music.
   </p>
   <p>
      Would I see them again? Every chance I get.
   </p>
   <p>
      Would I recommend them to a friend? Oh, yes. Absolutely!

         <i>The Pageant, 2023</i>
      </h3>
      <p>
         AshNikko has been another long time favorite. I started listening to her in 2018, so getting 
         to see her live was a dream come true. She absolutely exceeded all of my expectations and ideas 
         on how her show would go. Her stage presence was amazing, she told stories throughout her set about 
         the songs she was performing, and she played songs that showed off all of her fasets. We got to hear music
         from her older albums, songs from her newest album, and we even got a sneak peak at an unreleased song! 
         AshNikko is a close tie for first in my all time favorite concerts and I will be at her next show, see you there?
      </p>
      <p>
         Would I see her again? I would travel to the ends of the Earth for this woman.
      </p>
      <p>
         Would I recommend her to a friend? Yes a million times over.

         <i>The Old Rock House, 2024</i>
      </h3>
      <p>
         Maddie Zahm is a phenominal act. She has an incredible story that not only inspires 
         her music, but it encourages her fanbase. Maddie writes about her own struggles throug life as 
         an overweight, closeted queer woman. She has since lost weight and is in a happy, queer, relationship, 
         and that in itself has helped so many people who listen to her. Her show was extremely emotional and intimate. 
         She brought a local guest up on stage to play guitar and sing with her. She has a song called 'Little Me' and 
         its a song dedicated to her younger self; she sat on the stage and sang it directly to two little girls 
         standing in the front row. She touched the hearts of everyone in the building and it was such a beautiful experience.

         <i>Bonnaroo Music Festival, 2024</i>
      </h3>
      <p>
         Listening to Post Malone loudly in my car, can not even begin to macth up to how amazing of a performer he is.
         His show was extremely full, granted it was outside. Posty sounds identical to his recordings, he thanked the crowd after every song he performed, 
         and he put his all into each word. The stage was outsde, so we got fireworks and pyrotechnics! The energy of the crowd was contageous and everyone 
         was having such a good time. The crowd convinved him to chug his beer... twice! His beer guy was running back and forth all night!
         After seeing Posty live, I have become a bigger fan of him and I keep an eye out for any chance to see him live again.

      <p>
         Renee had an overall really cool show! She played songs from all of her eras, some of her favorites, and popular ones off of her newest album!
         Her voice is bone chilling to hear live and she knows how to use the stage. With that, she didn't enteract much with the crowd, and she cut her set short, 
         so that was a bummer. All in all, Renee Rapp was well worth the wait and deserves every bit of recognition for her phenominal voice.

         Would I see her again? Maybe, depends on the venue.

      <p>
         While I nearly passed out at Melanie's show, it was one of the most jaw dropping experineces of my life. She is another artists that I 
         have been a fan of for a very long time, so seeing her live was a check off my bucket list. The timing of her music was off a little bit,
         but to make up for that the choreography for each song was perfected, the set list was phenominal, and she told her story. Melanie did an eras 
         tour where she performed each of her albums, or eras, every show. At Bonnaroo we got a mini eras tour, she had picked a few songs off of each album
         to perform for us. With that, at the end of her show she asked the crowd to scream "Free Palestien" with her and hearing a crowd of that size screams
         was the cherry on top of it all.

        Would I see her again? Yes, without question.

      <p>
         When I went to see The Head and The Heart, I didnt know any more than 2 songs off of an old album of theirs. They are a lovely indie band that loves St. Louis! I had arrived early to the show
         and was waiting in line at the gates. The band came out to the gates and played us a sneak peak of an unrealeased song. They stated that it was a 
         tradition they had with St. Louis since they enjoyed bein there so muhc. They were such down to earth people and their music was even more beautiful live. 
         I had chills throughout most of the concert and they did a really good job of mixing up the vibes of the songs. They started with a few of their newer songs, mo 
         ubeat. Then moved into a few of their older songs which were a bit more mellow and calm, in the middle they brought the energy back up before ending it with 
         their most popular song. I was not expecting to enjoy their show as much as I did, but I was pleasently surprised. They took a lot of time to enteract witht the crowd
         and even played a song we had requested!
